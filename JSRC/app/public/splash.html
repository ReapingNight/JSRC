                            The player controlling the white pieces is called &#34;White&#34;, the player 
                            controlling the black pieces is called &#34;Black&#34;. 
                            White moves first, the players alternate turns. Making a move is required. 
                            The game continues until one king is checkmated, a player resigns or a draw is 
                            declared. In addition, if the game is being played under time control, 
                            players who exceed the time limit lose automatically.<br />
                            A piece is captured when attacking enemy replaces said piece on its square. 
                            This piece is then permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in 
                            check, but it cannot be captured.<br />

                            <br />
                            The game ends when one of the players successfully manages to capture the opponent&#39;s king.
                            This is only possible when the opponent&#39;s king is threatened and they have no direct means 
                            of averting the threat. This would effectively be checkmate, but in this version of chess, called&#58; 
                            &#34;Capture-The-King&#34;, the player is required to capture the king, for the game to end.
